Regional Ocean Modeling System

This is a branch of the ROMS code kept at myroms.org
(https://www.myroms.org/), containing sea ice and several other
changes people have contributed, notably the CoSiNE ecosystem model
and some ice shelf fixes. You are strongly encouraged to register with
myroms.org for access to the forum where this code is discussed.

This ice branch can be obtained at:
https://github.com/kshedstrom/roms

Note: I have created a separate repository for my application files at:
https://github.com/kshedstrom/Apps

The idea is that this should be a submodule of the ROMS repository.

Of the ocean.in files in the main code, I've been hit or miss on updating
things to be consistent with changes from my branch. The one to compare
to is in User/External/ocean.in which should be up to date.
